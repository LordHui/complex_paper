# Bayesian Sparsification of Deep Complex-valued Networks

This repository accompanies the paper `Bayesian Sparsification Methods for Deep Complex-valued Networks` and contains the source code of the library for reproducing its results en masse.

The key dependency is [cplxmodule](https://github.com/ivannz/cplxmodule) library, which implements the basic building blocks for complex-valued networks and the Bayesian sparsification methods described in the paper.
