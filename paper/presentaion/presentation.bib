	abstract = {At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations. However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks and convolutional LSTMs. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech Spectrum Prediction using the TIMIT dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on these audio-related tasks.},

	abstract = {We study the Automatic Relevance Determination procedure applied to deep neural networks. We show that ARD applied to Bayesian DNNs with Gaussian approximate posterior distributions leads to a variational bound similar to that of variational dropout, and in the case of a fixed dropout rate, objectives are exactly the same. Experimental results show that the two approaches yield comparable results in practice even when the dropout rates are trained. This leads to an alternative Bayesian interpretation of dropout and mitigates some of the theoretical issues that arise with the use of improper priors in the variational dropout model. Additionally, we explore the use of the hierarchical priors in ARD and show that it helps achieve higher sparsity for the same accuracy.},

The viewpoint is essential in general to deal with waves such as electromagnetic-wave and lightwave. Then we point out that, although we represent a complex number as an ordered pair of real numbers for example, we can reduce ineffective degree of freedom in learning or self-organization in CVNNs to achieve better generalization characteristics.

Our experiments show that DNNs with heterogeneous and learned bitwidth yield better performance than DNNs with a homogeneous one. Further, we show that there is one natural DQ parametrization especially well suited for training. We confirm our findings with experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and we obtain quantized DNNs with learned quantization parameters achieving state-of-the-art performance.},

	abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

	abstract = {We introduce FxpNet, a framework to train deep convolutional neural networks with low bit-width arithmetics in both forward pass and backward pass. During training FxpNet further reduces the bit-width of stored parameters (also known as primal parameters) by adaptively updating their fixed-point formats. These primal parameters are usually represented in the full resolution of floating-point values in previous binarized and quantized neural networks. In FxpNet, during forward pass fixed-point primal weights and activations are first binarized before computation, while in backward pass all gradients are represented as low resolution fixed-point values and then accumulated to corresponding fixed-point primal parameters. To have highly efficient implementations in FPGAs, ASICs and other dedicated devices, FxpNet introduces Integer Batch Normalization (IBN) and Fixed-point ADAM (FxpADAM) methods to further reduce the required floating-point operations, which will save considerable power and chip area. The evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset indicates the effectiveness that FxpNet with 12-bit primal parameters and 12-bit gradients achieves comparable prediction accuracy with state-of-the-art binarized and quantized neural networks.},

Compared with the real-valued network, the complex-value neural network is easier to optimize, generalize, and has better learning potential. This paper extends the commonly used deep compression algorithm from real domain to complex domain and proposes an improved deep compression algorithm for the compression of Complex CNN. The proposed algorithm compresses the network about 8 times on CIFAR-10 dataset with less than 3\% accuracy loss. On the ImageNet dataset, our method compresses the model about 16 times and the accuracy loss is about 2\% without retraining.},

	abstract = {In recent years, hyper-complex deep networks (e.g., quaternion-based) have received increasing interest with applications ranging from image reconstruction to 3D audio processing. Similarly to their real-valued counterparts, quaternion neural networks might require custom regularization strategies to avoid overfitting. In addition, for many real-world applications and embedded implementations there is the need of designing sufficiently compact networks, with as few weights and units as possible. However, the problem of how to regularize and/or sparsify quaternion-valued networks has not been properly addressed in the literature as of now. In this paper we show how to address both problems by designing targeted regularization strategies, able to minimize the number of connections and neurons of the network during training. To this end, we investigate two extensions of \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ and structured regularization to the quaternion domain. In our experimental evaluation, we show that these tailored strategies significantly outperform classical (real-valued) regularization strategies, resulting in small networks especially suitable for low-power and real-time applications.},

	abstract = {Digital predistortion is the process of correcting for nonlinearities in the analog RF front-end of a wireless transmitter. These nonlinearities contribute to adjacent channel leakage, degrade the error vector magnitude of transmitted signals, and often force the transmitter to reduce its transmission power into a more linear but less power-efficient region of the device. Most predistortion techniques are based on polynomial models with an indirect learning architecture which have been shown to be overly sensitive to noise. In this work, we use neural network based predistortion with a novel neural network training method that avoids the indirect learning architecture and that shows significant improvements in both the adjacent channel leakage ratio and error vector magnitude. Moreover, we show that, by using a neural network based predistorter, we are able to achieve a 42\% reduction in latency and 9.6\% increase in throughput on an FPGA accelerator with 15\% fewer multiplications per sample when compared to a similarly performing memory-polynomial implementation.},

We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned  beta {\textgreater} 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.},

	abstract = {Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149},
	abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {The remarkable successes of deep learning models across various applications have resulted in the design of deeper networks that can solve complex problems. However, the increasing depth of such models also results in a higher storage and runtime complexity, which restricts the deployability of such very deep models on mobile and portable devices, which have limited storage and battery capacity. While many methods have been proposed for deep model compression in recent years, almost all of them have focused on reducing storage complexity. In this work, we extend the teacher-student framework for deep model compression, since it has the potential to address runtime and train time complexity too. We propose a simple methodology to include a noise-based regularizer while training the student from the teacher, which provides a healthy improvement in the performance of the student network. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets show promising improvement, with the best performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed method under related settings on the CIFAR-10 dataset to show the promise of the proposed approach},

Moreover, a complex backpropagation algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent is derived for CV-CNN training. The proposed CV-CNN is then tested on the typical polarimetric SAR image classification task which classifies each pixel into known terrain types via supervised training. Experiments with the benchmark data sets of Flevoland and Oberpfaffenhofen show that the classification error can be further reduced if employing CV-CNN instead of conventional real-valued CNN with the same degrees of freedom. The performance of CV-CNN is comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall classification accuracy.},

However, deep networks are still outmatched by the power and versatility of the brain, perhaps in part due to the richer neuronal computations available to cortical circuits. The challenge is to identify which neuronal mechanisms are relevant, and to find suitable abstractions to model them. Here, we show how aspects of spike timing, long hypothesized to play a crucial role in cortical information processing, could be incorporated into deep networks to build richer, versatile representations. We introduce a neural network formulation based on complex-valued neuronal units that is not only biologically meaningful but also amenable to a variety of deep learning frameworks. Here, units are attributed both a firing rate and a phase, the latter indicating properties of spike timing. We show how this formulation qualitatively captures several aspects thought to be related to neuronal synchrony, including gating of information processing and dynamic binding of distributed object representations. Focusing on the latter, we demonstrate the potential of the approach in several simple experiments. Thus, neuronal synchrony could be a flexible mechanism that fulfills multiple functional roles in deep networks.},

For processing real-valued random vectors, complex-valued convnets can be viewed as "data-driven multiscale windowed power spectra," "data-driven multiscale windowed absolute spectra," "data-driven multiwavelet absolute values," or (in their most general configuration) "data-driven nonlinear multiwavelet packets." Indeed, complex-valued convnets can calculate multiscale windowed spectra when the convnet filters are windowed complex-valued exponentials. Standard real-valued convnets, using rectified linear units (ReLUs), sigmoidal (for example, logistic or tanh) nonlinearities, max. pooling, etc., do not obviously exhibit the same exact correspondence with data-driven wavelets (whereas for complex-valued convnets, the correspondence is much more than just a vague analogy). Courtesy of the exact correspondence, the remarkably rich and rigorous body of mathematical analysis for wavelets applies directly to (complex-valued) convnets.},

We assume a task of function approximation such as interpolation of temporal signals. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CVNNs with amplitude-phase-type activation function show smaller generalization error than real-valued networks, such as bivariate and dual-univariate real-valued neural networks.

	abstract = {This paper presents a fast learning fully complex-valued classifier to solve real-valued classification problems, called the `Fast Learning Complex-valued Neural Classifier' (FLCNC). The FLCNC is a single hidden layer network with a non-linear, real to complex transformed input layer, a hidden layer with a fully complex activation function and a linear output layer. The neurons in the input layer convert the real-valued input features to the Complex domain using an unique non-linear transformation. At the hidden layer, the complex-valued transformed input features are mapped onto a higher dimensional Complex plane using a fully complex-valued activation function of the type of `sech'. The parameters of the input and hidden neurons of the FLCNC are chosen randomly and the output parameters are estimated analytically which makes the FLCNC to perform fast classification. Moreover, the unique nonlinear input transformation and the orthogonal decision boundaries of the complex-valued neural network help the FLCNC to perform accurate classification. Performance of the FLCNC is demonstrated using a set of multi-category and binary real valued classification problems with both balanced and unbalanced data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. Performance comparison with existing complex-valued and real-valued classifiers show the superior classification performance of the FLCNC.},

Different from most existing works which rely on the utilization of the coil sensitivities or prior information of predefined transforms, DeepcomplexMRI takes advantage of the availability of a large number of existing multi-channel groudtruth images and uses them as target data to train the deep residual convolutional neural network offline. In particular, a complex convolutional network is proposed to take into account the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of MR images. In addition, the k-space data consistency is further enforced repeatedly in between layers of the network. The evaluations on in vivo datasets show that the proposed method has the capability to recover the desired multi-channel images. Its comparison with state-of-the-art methods also demonstrates that the proposed method can reconstruct the desired MR images more accurately.},

	abstract = {High demand for computation resources severely hinders deployment of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in resource constrained devices. In this work, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the structures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs. SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently accelerate the DNNs evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on average 5.1x and 3.1x speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth can reduce 20 layers of a Deep Residual Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improve the accuracy from 91.25\% to 92.60\%, which is still slightly higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For AlexNet, structure regularization by SSL also reduces the error by around {\textasciitilde}1\%. Open source code is in https://github.com/wenwei202/caffe/tree/scnn},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08026},
	abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are a powerful modeling tool for domains where data can be naturally interpreted in terms of complex numbers. However, several analytical properties of the complex domain (e.g., holomorphicity) make the design of CVNNs a more challenging task than their real counterpart. In this paper, we consider the problem of flexible activation functions (AFs) in the complex domain, i.e., AFs endowed with sufficient degrees of freedom to adapt their shape given the training data. While this problem has received considerable attention in the real case, a very limited literature exists for CVNNs, where most activation functions are generally developed in a split fashion (i.e., by considering the real and imaginary parts of the activation separately) or with simple phase-amplitude techniques. Leveraging over the recently proposed kernel activation functions (KAFs), and related advances in the design of complex-valued kernels, we propose the first fully complex, non-parametric activation function for CVNNs, which is based on a kernel expansion with a fixed dictionary that can be implemented efficiently on vectorized hardware. Several experiments on common use cases, including prediction and channel equalization, validate our proposal when compared to real-valued neural networks and CVNNs with fixed activation functions.},

	abstract = {The learning capability of a neural network improves with increasing depth at higher computational costs. Wider layers with dense kernel connectivity patterns furhter increase this cost and may hinder real-time inference. We propose feature map and kernel level pruning for reducing the computational complexity of a deep convolutional neural network. Pruning feature maps reduces the width of a layer and hence does not need any sparse representation. Further, kernel pruning converts the dense connectivity pattern into a sparse one. Due to coarse nature, these pruning granularities can be exploited by GPUs and VLSI based implementations. We propose a simple and generic strategy to choose the least adversarial pruning masks for both granularities. The pruned networks are retrained which compensates the loss in accuracy. We obtain the best pruning ratios when we prune a network with both granularities. Experiments with the CIFAR-10 dataset show that more than 85\% sparsity can be induced in the convolution layers with less than 1\% increase in the missclassification rate of the baseline network.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) has become the most promising method for object recognition, repeatedly demonstrating record breaking results for image classification and object detection in recent years. However, a very deep CNN generally involves many layers with millions of parameters, making the storage of the network model to be extremely large. This prohibits the usage of deep CNNs on resource limited hardware, especially cell phones or other embedded devices. In this paper, we tackle this model storage issue by investigating information theoretical vector quantization methods for compressing the parameters of CNNs. In particular, we have found in terms of compressing the most storage demanding dense connected layers, vector quantization methods have a clear gain over existing matrix factorization methods. Simply applying k-means clustering to the weights or conducting product quantization can lead to a very good balance between model size and recognition accuracy. For the 1000-category classification task in the ImageNet challenge, we are able to achieve 16-24 times compression of the network with only 1\% loss of classification accuracy using the state-of-the-art CNN.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07683},
	abstract = {Magnitude pruning is a widely used strategy for reducing model size in pure supervised learning; however, it is less effective in the transfer learning regime that has become standard for state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. We propose the use of movement pruning, a simple, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more adaptive to pretrained model fine-tuning. We give mathematical foundations to the method and compare it to existing zeroth- and first-order pruning methods. Experiments show that when pruning large pretrained language models, movement pruning shows significant improvements in high-sparsity regimes. When combined with distillation, the approach achieves minimal accuracy loss with down to only 3\% of the model parameters.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICNN.1993.298572},
	abstract = {The use of information from all second-order derivatives of the error function to perform network pruning (i.e., removing unimportant weights from a trained network) in order to improve generalization, simplify networks, reduce hardware or storage requirements, increase the speed of further training, and, in some cases, enable rule extraction, is investigated. The method, Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), is significantly better than magnitude-based methods and Optimal Brain Damage, which often remove the wrong weights. OBS, permits pruning of more weights than other methods (for the same error on the training set), and thus yields better generalization on test data. Crucial to OBS is a recursion relation for calculating the inverse Hessian matrix H/sup -1/ from training data and structural information of the set. OBS deletes the correct weights from a trained XOR network in every case.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
