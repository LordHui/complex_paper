	abstract = {We rigorously evaluate three state-of-the-art techniques for inducing sparsity in deep neural networks on two large-scale learning tasks: Transformer trained on WMT 2014 English-to-German, and ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet. Across thousands of experiments, we demonstrate that complex techniques (Molchanov et al., 2017; Louizos et al., 2017b) shown to yield high compression rates on smaller datasets perform inconsistently, and that simple magnitude pruning approaches achieve comparable or better results. Additionally, we replicate the experiments performed by (Frankle \& Carbin, 2018) and (Liu et al., 2018) at scale and show that unstructured sparse architectures learned through pruning cannot be trained from scratch to the same test set performance as a model trained with joint sparsification and optimization. Together, these results highlight the need for large-scale benchmarks in the field of model compression. We open-source our code, top performing model checkpoints, and results of all hyperparameter configurations to establish rigorous baselines for future work on compression and sparsification.},

	abstract = {We study the Automatic Relevance Determination procedure applied to deep neural networks. We show that ARD applied to Bayesian DNNs with Gaussian approximate posterior distributions leads to a variational bound similar to that of variational dropout, and in the case of a fixed dropout rate, objectives are exactly the same. Experimental results show that the two approaches yield comparable results in practice even when the dropout rates are trained. This leads to an alternative Bayesian interpretation of dropout and mitigates some of the theoretical issues that arise with the use of improper priors in the variational dropout model. Additionally, we explore the use of the hierarchical priors in ARD and show that it helps achieve higher sparsity for the same accuracy.},

	url = {https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Y8hhg0b},
	abstract = {We propose a practical method for \$L\_0\$ norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of \$L\_0\$ regularization. However, since the \$L\_0\$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected \$L\_0\$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the {\textbackslash}emph\{hard concrete\} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by "stretching" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

The recent compression works are focused on real-value convolutional neural network (Real CNN), however, to our knowledge, there is no attempt for the compression of complex-value convolutional neural network (Complex CNN). Compared with the real-valued network, the complex-value neural network is easier to optimize, generalize, and has better learning potential. This paper extends the commonly used deep compression algorithm from real domain to complex domain and proposes an improved deep compression algorithm for the compression of Complex CNN. The proposed algorithm compresses the network about 8 times on CIFAR-10 dataset with less than 3\% accuracy loss. On the ImageNet dataset, our method compresses the model about 16 times and the accuracy loss is about 2\% without retraining.},

	url = {https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1iIDkPM},
	abstract = {Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.},

	abstract = {In recent years, hyper-complex deep networks (e.g., quaternion-based) have received increasing interest with applications ranging from image reconstruction to 3D audio processing. Similarly to their real-valued counterparts, quaternion neural networks might require custom regularization strategies to avoid overfitting. In addition, for many real-world applications and embedded implementations there is the need of designing sufficiently compact networks, with as few weights and units as possible. However, the problem of how to regularize and/or sparsify quaternion-valued networks has not been properly addressed in the literature as of now. In this paper we show how to address both problems by designing targeted regularization strategies, able to minimize the number of connections and neurons of the network during training. To this end, we investigate two extensions of \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ and structured regularization to the quaternion domain. In our experimental evaluation, we show that these tailored strategies significantly outperform classical (real-valued) regularization strategies, resulting in small networks especially suitable for low-power and real-time applications.},

	abstract = {Digital predistortion is the process of correcting for nonlinearities in the analog RF front-end of a wireless transmitter. These nonlinearities contribute to adjacent channel leakage, degrade the error vector magnitude of transmitted signals, and often force the transmitter to reduce its transmission power into a more linear but less power-efficient region of the device. Most predistortion techniques are based on polynomial models with an indirect learning architecture which have been shown to be overly sensitive to noise. In this work, we use neural network based predistortion with a novel neural network training method that avoids the indirect learning architecture and that shows significant improvements in both the adjacent channel leakage ratio and error vector magnitude. Moreover, we show that, by using a neural network based predistorter, we are able to achieve a 42\% reduction in latency and 9.6\% increase in throughput on an FPGA accelerator with 15\% fewer multiplications per sample when compared to a similarly performing memory-polynomial implementation.},

Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned  beta {\textgreater} 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.},
