	abstract = {At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations. However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks and convolutional LSTMs. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech Spectrum Prediction using the TIMIT dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on these audio-related tasks.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks are not a new concept, however, the use of real-valued models has often been favoured over complex-valued models due to difficulties in training and performance. When comparing real-valued versus complex-valued neural networks, existing literature often ignores the number of parameters, resulting in comparisons of neural networks with vastly different sizes. We find that when real and complex neural networks of similar capacity are compared, complex models perform equal to or slightly worse than real-valued models for a range of real-valued classification tasks. The use of complex numbers allows neural networks to handle noise on the complex plane. When classifying real-valued data with a complex-valued neural network, the imaginary parts of the weights follow their real parts. This behaviour is indicative for a task that does not require a complex-valued model. We further investigated this in a synthetic classification task. We can transfer many activation functions from the real to the complex domain using different strategies. The weight initialisation of complex neural networks, however, remains a significant problem.},

Additionally, we replicate the experiments performed by (Frankle \& Carbin, 2018) and (Liu et al., 2018) at scale and show that unstructured sparse architectures learned through pruning cannot be trained from scratch to the same test set performance as a model trained with joint sparsification and optimization. Together, these results highlight the need for large-scale benchmarks in the field of model compression. We open-source our code, top performing model checkpoints, and results of all hyperparameter configurations to establish rigorous baselines for future work on compression and sparsification.},

In this paper, we investigate the inﬂuence of these properties on important information theoretic quantities such as entropy, divergence, and capacity. We prove two maximum entropy theorems that strengthen previously known results. The proof of the ﬁrst maximum entropy theorem is based on the so-called circular analog of a given complex-valued random vector. The introduction of the circular analog is additionally supported by a characterization theorem that employs a minimum Kullback–Leibler divergence criterion. In the proof of the second maximum entropy theorem, results about the second-order structure of complex-valued random vectors are exploited. Furthermore, we address the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Regardless of the speciﬁc distribution of the channel parameters (noise vector and channel matrix, if modeled as random), we show that the capacity-achieving input vector is circular for a broad range of MIMO channels (including coherent and noncoherent scenarios). Finally, we investigate the situation of an improper and Gaussian distributed noise vector. We compute both capacity and capacity-achieving input vector and show that improperness increases capacity, provided that the complementary covariance matrix is exploited. Otherwise, a capacity loss occurs, for which we derive an explicit expression.},

	abstract = {The reparameterization trick enables optimizing large scale stochastic computation graphs via gradient descent. The essence of the trick is to refactor each stochastic node into a differentiable function of its parameters and a random variable with fixed distribution. After refactoring, the gradients of the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack useful reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce Concrete random variables---continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The Concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, Concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-probability of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Concrete relaxations on density estimation and structured prediction tasks using neural networks.},

	abstract = {We propose a practical method for \$L\_0\$ norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of \$L\_0\$ regularization. However, since the \$L\_0\$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected \$L\_0\$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the {\textbackslash}emph\{hard concrete\} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by "stretching" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

	abstract = {A technique is proposed for the derivation of upper bounds on channel capacity. It is based on a dual expression for channel capacity where the maximization (of mutual information) over distributions on the channel input alphabet is replaced with a minimization (of average relative entropy) over distributions on the channel output alphabet. We also propose a technique for the analysis of the asymptotic capacity of cost-constrained channels. The technique is based on the observation that under fairly mild conditions capacity achieving input distributions "escape to infinity." The above techniques are applied to multiple-antenna flat-fading channels with memory where the realization of the fading process is unknown at the transmitter and unknown (or only partially known) at the receiver. It is demonstrated that, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the capacity of such channels typically grows only double-logarithmically in the SNR. To better understand this phenomenon and the rates at which it occurs, we introduce the fading number as the second-order term in the high-SNR asymptotic expansion of capacity, and derive estimates on its value for various systems. It is suggested that at rates that are significantly higher than the fading number, communication becomes extremely power inefficient, thus posing a practical limit on practically achievable rates. Upper and lower bounds on the fading number are also presented. For single-input-single-output (SISO) systems the bounds coincide, thus yielding a complete characterization of the fading number for general stationary and ergodic fading processes. We also demonstrate that for memoryless multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels, the fading number is achievable using beam-forming, and we derive an expression for the optimal beam direction. This direction depends on the fading law and is, in general, not the direction that maximizes the SNR on the induced SISO channel. Using a new closed-form expression for the expectation of the logarithm of a noncentral chi-square distributed random variable we provide some closed-form expressions for the fading number of some systems with Gaussian fading, including SISO systems with circularly symmetric stationary and ergodic Gaussian fading. The fading number of the latter is determined by the fading mean, fading variance, and the mean squared error in predicting the present fading from its past; it is not directly related to the Doppler spread. For the Rayleigh, Ricean, and multiple-antenna Rayleigh-fading channels we also present firm (nonasymptotic) upper and lower bounds on channel capacity. These bounds are asymptotically tight in the sense that their difference from capacity approaches zero at high SNR, and their ratio to capacity approaches one at low SNR.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued signals occur in many areas of science and engineering and are thus of fundamental interest. In the past, it has often been assumed, usually implicitly, that complex random signals are proper or circular. A proper complex random variable is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate, and a circular complex random variable has a probability distribution that is invariant under rotation in the complex plane. While these assumptions are convenient because they simplify computations, there are many cases where proper and circular random signals are very poor models of the underlying physics. When taking impropriety and noncircularity into account, the right type of processing can provide significant performance gains. There are two key ingredients in the statistical signal processing of complex-valued data: 1) utilizing the complete statistical characterization of complex-valued random signals; and 2) the optimization of real-valued cost functions with respect to complex parameters. In this overview article, we review the necessary tools, among which are widely linear transformations, augmented statistical descriptions, and Wirtinger calculus. We also present some selected recent developments in the field of complex-valued signal processing, addressing the topics of model selection, filtering, and source separation.},
