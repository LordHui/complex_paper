	abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks are not a new concept, however, the use of real-valued models has often been favoured over complex-valued models due to difficulties in training and performance. When comparing real-valued versus complex-valued neural networks, existing literature often ignores the number of parameters, resulting in comparisons of neural networks with vastly different sizes. We find that when real and complex neural networks of similar capacity are compared, complex models perform equal to or slightly worse than real-valued models for a range of real-valued classification tasks. The use of complex numbers allows neural networks to handle noise on the complex plane. When classifying real-valued data with a complex-valued neural network, the imaginary parts of the weights follow their real parts. This behaviour is indicative for a task that does not require a complex-valued model. We further investigated this in a synthetic classification task. We can transfer many activation functions from the real to the complex domain using different strategies. The weight initialisation of complex neural networks, however, remains a significant problem.},

	abstract = {Telecommunication networks make extensive use of power amplifiers to broaden the coverage from transmitter to receiver. Achieving high power efficiency is challenging and comes at a price: the wanted linear performance is degraded due to nonlinear effects. To compensate for these nonlinear disturbances, existing techniques compute the pre-inverse of the power amplifier by estimation of a nonlinear model. However, the extraction of this nonlinear model is involved and requires advanced system identification techniques. We used the plant inversion iterative learning control algorithm to investigate whether the nonlinear modeling step can be simplified. This paper introduces the iterative learning control framework for the pre-inverse estimation and predistortion of power amplifiers. The iterative learning control algorithm is used to obtain a high quality predistorted input for the power amplifier under study without requiring a nonlinear model of the power amplifier. In a second step a nonlinear pre-inverse model of the amplifier is obtained. Both the nonlinear and memory effects of a power amplifier can be compensated by this approach. The convergence of the iterative approach, and the predistortion results are illustrated on a simulation of a Motorola LDMOS transistor based power amplifier and a measurement example using the Chalmers RF WebLab measurement setup.},

	abstract = {A technique is proposed for the derivation of upper bounds on channel capacity. It is based on a dual expression for channel capacity where the maximization (of mutual information) over distributions on the channel input alphabet is replaced with a minimization (of average relative entropy) over distributions on the channel output alphabet. We also propose a technique for the analysis of the asymptotic capacity of cost-constrained channels. The technique is based on the observation that under fairly mild conditions capacity achieving input distributions "escape to infinity." The above techniques are applied to multiple-antenna flat-fading channels with memory where the realization of the fading process is unknown at the transmitter and unknown (or only partially known) at the receiver. It is demonstrated that, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the capacity of such channels typically grows only double-logarithmically in the SNR. To better understand this phenomenon and the rates at which it occurs, we introduce the fading number as the second-order term in the high-SNR asymptotic expansion of capacity, and derive estimates on its value for various systems. It is suggested that at rates that are significantly higher than the fading number, communication becomes extremely power inefficient, thus posing a practical limit on practically achievable rates. Upper and lower bounds on the fading number are also presented. For single-input-single-output (SISO) systems the bounds coincide, thus yielding a complete characterization of the fading number for general stationary and ergodic fading processes. We also demonstrate that for memoryless multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels, the fading number is achievable using beam-forming, and we derive an expression for the optimal beam direction. This direction depends on the fading law and is, in general, not the direction that maximizes the SNR on the induced SISO channel. Using a new closed-form expression for the expectation of the logarithm of a noncentral chi-square distributed random variable we provide some closed-form expressions for the fading number of some systems with Gaussian fading, including SISO systems with circularly symmetric stationary and ergodic Gaussian fading. The fading number of the latter is determined by the fading mean, fading variance, and the mean squared error in predicting the present fading from its past; it is not directly related to the Doppler spread. For the Rayleigh, Ricean, and multiple-antenna Rayleigh-fading channels we also present firm (nonasymptotic) upper and lower bounds on channel capacity. These bounds are asymptotically tight in the sense that their difference from capacity approaches zero at high SNR, and their ratio to capacity approaches one at low SNR.},

	abstract = {Digital predistortion is the process of correcting for nonlinearities in the analog RF front-end of a wireless transmitter. These nonlinearities contribute to adjacent channel leakage, degrade the error vector magnitude of transmitted signals, and often force the transmitter to reduce its transmission power into a more linear but less power-efficient region of the device. Most predistortion techniques are based on polynomial models with an indirect learning architecture which have been shown to be overly sensitive to noise. In this work, we use neural network based predistortion with a novel neural network training method that avoids the indirect learning architecture and that shows significant improvements in both the adjacent channel leakage ratio and error vector magnitude. Moreover, we show that, by using a neural network based predistorter, we are able to achieve a 42\% reduction in latency and 9.6\% increase in throughput on an FPGA accelerator with 15\% fewer multiplications per sample when compared to a similarly performing memory-polynomial implementation.},

Being aware of potential impropriety can be crucial whenever we model signals as complex random quantities since an appropriate treatment of improper signals, e.g., by widely linear filtering, can significantly improve the system performance. After a brief introduction into the fundamentals of improper signals, this article focuses on the problem of quantifying the impropriety of complex random vectors and gives a survey of various impropriety measures in both the composite real representation and the augmented complex formulation. Unlike in previous publications, these two frameworks are presented side by side to reveal the differences and common points between them. Moreover, their applicability is compared in several practical examples. As additional aspects, we consider the problem of testing for impropriety based on measurement data, and the differential entropy of Gaussian vectors as an impropriety measure in information theoretic studies. The article includes a tutorial-style introduction, a collection of important formulae, a comparison of various mathematical approaches, as well as some new reformulations.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued signals occur in many areas of science and engineering and are thus of fundamental interest. In the past, it has often been assumed, usually implicitly, that complex random signals are proper or circular. A proper complex random variable is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate, and a circular complex random variable has a probability distribution that is invariant under rotation in the complex plane. While these assumptions are convenient because they simplify computations, there are many cases where proper and circular random signals are very poor models of the underlying physics. When taking impropriety and noncircularity into account, the right type of processing can provide significant performance gains. There are two key ingredients in the statistical signal processing of complex-valued data: 1) utilizing the complete statistical characterization of complex-valued random signals; and 2) the optimization of real-valued cost functions with respect to complex parameters. In this overview article, we review the necessary tools, among which are widely linear transformations, augmented statistical descriptions, and Wirtinger calculus. We also present some selected recent developments in the field of complex-valued signal processing, addressing the topics of model selection, filtering, and source separation.},

Such limitation motivates research to enlarge the group of probability distributions, allowing a wider scope of applicability. This study provides a theoretical proof for the closed-form of a generalized proper complex Gaussian ratio distribution using the principle of probability density transformation in tandem with an advanced integral technique. The equivalence between the distribution properties of complex ratio random variables and their counterparts in the real-valued domain is also proven.

	abstract = {We propose a practical method for \$L\_0\$ norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of \$L\_0\$ regularization. However, since the \$L\_0\$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected \$L\_0\$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the {\textbackslash}emph\{hard concrete\} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by "stretching" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

The essence of the trick is to refactor each stochastic node into a differentiable function of its parameters and a random variable with fixed distribution. After refactoring, the gradients of the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack useful reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce Concrete random variables---continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The Concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, Concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-probability of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph.

However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks and convolutional LSTMs. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech Spectrum Prediction using the TIMIT dataset.

We extend Variational Dropout to the case when dropout rates are unbounded, propose a way to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator and report first experimental results with individual dropout rates per weight.

This effect is similar to automatic relevance determination effect in empirical Bayes but has a number of advantages.

There are advantages to the frequency-domain representation, e.g., the human auditory system is known to process sound in the frequency-domain. Furthermore, linear time-invariant systems are convolved with sources in the time-domain, whereas they may be factorized in the frequency-domain. Neural networks have become rather useful when applied to audio tasks such as machine listening and audio synthesis, which are related by their dependencies on high quality acoustic models. They ideally encapsulate fine-scale temporal structure, such as that encoded in the phase of frequency-domain audio, yet there are no authoritative deep learning methods for complex audio. This manuscript is dedicated to addressing the shortcoming.},

In this paper, we investigate the inﬂuence of these properties on important information theoretic quantities such as entropy, divergence, and capacity. We prove two maximum entropy theorems that strengthen previously known results. The proof of the ﬁrst maximum entropy theorem is based on the so-called circular analog of a given complex-valued random vector. The introduction of the circular analog is additionally supported by a characterization theorem that employs a minimum Kullback–Leibler divergence criterion. In the proof of the second maximum entropy theorem, results about the second-order structure of complex-valued random vectors are exploited. Furthermore, we address the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Regardless of the speciﬁc distribution of the channel parameters (noise vector and channel matrix, if modeled as random), we show that the capacity-achieving input vector is circular for a broad range of MIMO channels (including coherent and noncoherent scenarios). Finally, we investigate the situation of an improper and Gaussian distributed noise vector. We compute both capacity and capacity-achieving input vector and show that improperness increases capacity, provided that the complementary covariance matrix is exploited. Otherwise, a capacity loss occurs, for which we derive an explicit expression.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued data arise in various applications, such as radar and array signal processing, magnetic resonance imaging, communication systems, and processing data in the frequency domain. To deal with such data properly, neural networks are extended to the complex domain, referred to as complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs), allowing the network parameters to be complex numbers and the computations to follow the complex algebraic rules. Unlike the real-valued case, the nonlinear functions in the CVNNs do not have standard complex derivatives as the Cauchy-Riemann equations do not hold for them. Consequently, the traditional approach for deriving learning algorithms reformulates the problem in the real domain which is often tedious. In this thesis, we first develop a systematic and simpler approach using Wirtinger calculus to derive the learning algorithms in the CVNNs. It is shown that adopting three steps: (i) computing a pair of derivatives in the conjugate coordinate system, (ii) using coordinate transformation between real and conjugate coordinates, and (iii) organizing derivative computations through functional dependency graph greatly simplify the derivations. To illustrate, a gradient descent and LevenbergMarquardt algorithms are considered.

Although a single-layered network, referred to as functional link network (FLN), has been widely used in the real domain because of its simplicity and faster processing, no such study exists in the complex domain. In the FLN, the nonlinearity is endowed in the input layer by constructing linearly independent basis functions in addition to the original variables. We design a parsimonious complex-valued FLN (CFLN) using orthogonal least squares (OLS) method, where the basis functions are multivariate polynomial terms. It is observed that the OLS based CFLN yields simple structure with favorable performance comparing to the multilayer CVNNs in several applications.

It is well known and interesting that a complex-valued neuron can solve several nonlinearly separable problems, including the XOR, parity-n, and symmetry detection problems, which a real-valued neuron cannot. With this motivation, we perform an empirical study of classification performance of single-layered CVNNs on several real-world benchmark classification problems with two new activation functions. The experimental results exhibit that the classification performances of single-layered CVNNs are comparable to those of multilayer real-valued neural networks. Further enhancement of discrimination ability has been obtained using the ensemble approach.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks are not a new concept, however, the use of real-valued models has often been favoured over complex-valued models due to difficulties in training and performance. When comparing real-valued versus complex-valued neural networks, existing literature often ignores the number of parameters, resulting in comparisons of neural networks with vastly different sizes. We find that when real and complex neural networks of similar capacity are compared, complex models perform equal to or slightly worse than real-valued models for a range of real-valued classification tasks. The use of complex numbers allows neural networks to handle noise on the complex plane. When classifying real-valued data with a complex-valued neural network, the imaginary parts of the weights follow their real parts. This behaviour is indicative for a task that does not require a complex-valued model. We further investigated this in a synthetic classification task. We can transfer many activation functions from the real to the complex domain using different strategies. The weight initialisation of complex neural networks, however, remains a significant problem.},

High power amplifier is one of the most nonlinear components in radio transmitters. Baseband adaptive digital predistortion is a powerful technique to linearize the power amplifiers and allows to push the power amplifier operation point towards its high efficiency region. Linearization of power amplifiers using digital predistortion with low complexities is the focus of this dissertation. An algorithm is proposed to determine an optimal model structure of single-stage or multi-stage predistorter according to a trade-off between modeling accuracy and model complexity. Multi-stage cascaded digital predistortions are studied with different identification methods, which have advantages on complexity of model identification compared with single-stage structure. In terms of experimental implementations, this dissertation studies the impact of different gain choices on linearized power amplifier. All studies are evaluated with a Doherty power amplifier.},

To address this, we reexamine variational inference from its roots as an optimization problem. We use operators, or functions of functions, to design variational objectives. As one example, we design a variational objective with a Langevin-Stein operator. We develop a black box algorithm, operator variational inference (OPVI), for optimizing any operator objective. Importantly, operators enable us to make explicit the statistical and computational tradeoffs for variational inference. We can characterize different properties of variational objectives, such as objectives that admit data subsampling---allowing inference to scale to massive data---as well as objectives that admit variational programs---a rich class of posterior approximations that does not require a tractable density.
